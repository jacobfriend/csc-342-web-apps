1. An interesting challenge you encountered when implementing JTW algorithms. What was the issue, and how did you solve it?

2. What security risks/vulnerabilities/weaknesses, if any, are present in your implementation? How can they be exploited, and what are some ways to fix them? Are there any tradeoffs if you implement any of the fixes?
