## Basic Calculator
# Contents
* [Basic Calculator](index.html)

# Styling Decisions:
* CSS Grid Layout for the calculator buttons.
* Flexbox used for the calculator and history containers.
* Went for simple calculator design with a basic color scheme.

# Challenges:
* Writing concise code with the FSM logic. Want to make the code
as readible, short, and simple as possible. Lots of conditionals included
in FSM logic.
* Struggled with flexbox and resizing the container components more than
I thought I would. Still need some more practice there.
* If I had more time, I would add more reactive styling to the calculator
such as button clicks, display animations, etc.
* Struggled to add the backspace functionality, an additional feature I wanted
to add.
