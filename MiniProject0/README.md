## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think the ungrading practice is a great approach to maximing student and teaching performance in the classroom. Throughout my
experience with grading, I many times have found myself incentivized to work towards higher grades instead of a learning threshold.Additionally, I have struggled to learn from my failures in previous classes because of a lack of feedback based on my performance.
My initial thoughts about ungrading are that I will be able to maximize my learning of a particular subject because the focus has been shifted away from grades and towards my current skills and the path to grow. I also think ungrading benefits teaching by putting the teaching staff more in-tune with the performance of the students in the class. By providing qualitative feedback, teaching staff must consider each student's skills and give relevant feedback which can help the students to improve their learning.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I believe that this class will require more time and effort to ensure my success in learning the material. However, I believe there are many more opportunities for growth in this class because of the flipped class format. This class seems to encourage risk taking and learning from mistakes because of the nature of the ungrading feedback process. When failure is not penalized, I can take more  agency in my own learning by improving based on feedback as opposed to sticking to a rigid grading scale structure.

## 3. On a scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
