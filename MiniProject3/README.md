## Pay Your Friends
# Contents
* [Pay Your Friends](templates/form.html)


# Styling Decisions:
* Followed the wireframe very closely
* Simple form with different sections based on input details (sender, recipient, and payment)
* Green color theme to compliment the behavior monetary transactions
* Used color coding around input fields to represent valid/invalid user input

# Challenges:
* The card input behavior was difficult in regards to automatically adding/removing the hyphens depending on how many numbers were in the card number
