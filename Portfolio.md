| Original   | 2024-10-11     | Meets Expectations | Overall, great job but need to fix server that's not running in detach mode, multer configuration, card expiration date, and card number format. | Modified compose.yml and Dockerfile and ran my projects in detached mode, updated my multer configuration to allow for viewing the images uploaded by the user, updated the card expiration date to MM/YY, and updated the card number format to automatically insert hyphens after a group of 4 numbers. |
