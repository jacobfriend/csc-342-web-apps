## Static Websites
# Contents
* [Static Newspaper Landing Page](Part1/landing.html)
* [Everyone Loves Aesthetics](Part2/dashboard.html)

# Styling Decisions:
* I want the google font to give the feeling of fierce, thrilling competition. The New Amsterdam from google font gives conveys this well with the strong font weight combined with the video game-like style.
* The grid layout of my newspaper page was used to represent importance of each article. I wanted to demonstrate
more important articles with the proportion of the grid they use. Trending articles took up more space because
of the theoretical content inside of them.

# Challenges:
* Screen scaling was a big challenge throughout this project for me. When developing my website using the 
preview add-on in VS Code, I thought my website looked clean until I opened the website in my browser. I had to 
make adjustments to the units of my gaps, padding, font sizes and more, in order to have the website scale better
depending on the window size.
* I enjoyed playing with grid box logistics, but it took a while to grasp the concept of going from a wireframe idea
of a grid to implementation. It took lots of trial and error for finding what fractional unit would be best suited for
the grid layout I wanted, and how it would interact with the rest of the site.
